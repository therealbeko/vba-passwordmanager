# vba-passwordmanager

<hr>

<p>For our school project in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), we aimed to realize the concept of a Password Manager. This endeavor was focused on creating a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that would be accessible through a master password. Our goal was to provide a platform where users could easily generate strong passwords, create new entries, and categorize them as per their liking. Security was a major priority, with the project featuring encryption and decryption functionalities to safeguard sensitive information. Unlike initial considerations for multiple storage solutions, we decided to exclusively utilize a secure SQL database for data storage. This decision was made to ensure the integrity and security of the data, aligning with our commitment to create an efficient and secure password management system. This system was designed to be intuitive and meet the diverse needs of users, all within the scope of a VBA school project dedicated to developing a proficient Password Manager.</p>
